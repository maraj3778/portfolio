            I’m Maraj Siddiki. I’m a designer who write codes. I’ve worked in-house, and remotely on projects for leading brands, agencies, startups, and charities. I care deeply about creating world-class, useful, and beautiful web products that help people and make a difference. I can be as involved in your project as you need me to be; from the seed of the idea, to sketches, creative direction, design, copywriting, system design, and even the front-end.
